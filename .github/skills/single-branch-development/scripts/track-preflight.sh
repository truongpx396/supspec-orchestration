#!/usr/bin/env bash
# track-preflight.sh — Start gate: mint (or recover) a stable RUN_ID, verify the run can
# actually proceed, and disambiguate START vs RESUME from a durable breadcrumb. Solves the
# "humans can't reproduce a RUN_ID from memory" footgun: the id is generated once and
# persisted to runs/<RUN_ID>.dispatch, so a later resume reads it back instead of guessing.
#
# Two phases (so the skill can show a summary, get confirmation, THEN persist):
#   inspect (default)  — detect resume-vs-fresh, check prerequisites, print a summary +
#                        emit JSON to stdout. READ-ONLY: writes nothing. Exit non-zero only
#                        on a HARD prerequisite failure (missing gh/git/toolchain) — a
#                        missing dep is not a preference, it blocks in every mode.
#   --persist          — persist runs/<RUN_ID>.dispatch (the breadcrumb) after the caller
#                        has confirmed. Idempotent: re-persisting the same id is a no-op.
#                        (--commit stays as a deprecated alias for --persist.)
#   --complete         — stamp completed_utc + duration_secs (now − created_utc) onto the
#                        breadcrumb at draft-PR handoff. Write-once; the honest home for
#                        "total run time" (a per-event hook never sees PR handoff).
#
# Confirmation waiver (--yes / AUTO_CONFIRM=1):
#   The SKILL requires a HUMAN to approve the summary below before anything is created.
#   That is impossible for a worker fanned out by executing-parallel-tracks: there is no
#   human on the other end of a dispatched subagent, so an un-waivable confirm makes the
#   worker either hang forever or silently self-waive — and N workers each guessing is
#   worse than either. `--yes` (or AUTO_CONFIRM=1) is the EXPLICIT, RECORDED waiver: the
#   orchestrator already took the human confirmation once, at its own wave-plan gate.
#   It waives ONLY the interactive proceed-confirm. It does NOT waive prerequisites —
#   a missing bin / unauthed gh still hard-fails, because a missing dep is not a
#   preference. The waiver is stamped into the summary, the JSON (auto_confirm:true),
#   and the persisted breadcrumb, so an audit can always tell an approved run from a
#   waived one.
#
# Inputs (env or args):
#   TRACK_ID     short track slug (e.g. setup, us1). REQUIRED.
#   TASKS        human task range for the summary/breadcrumb (e.g. "T001-T009"). Optional.
#   RUN_ID       override the minted id (rare). If a breadcrumb for this TRACK_ID already
#                exists, its id WINS (resume) unless RUN_ID is set explicitly.
#   RUNS_DIR     default "runs".
#   TRACK_BRANCH target branch name to work to. Optional — empty derives it from the track
#                slug. Validated with `git check-ref-format` so a bad name fails here.
#   TRACK_BASE_REF / default_branch  base for the new branch (summary only; default main).
#   PREFLIGHT_REQUIRE_TOOLCHAIN  comma list of extra bins to require (e.g. "go,uv,node").
#   PREFLIGHT_REQUIRE_GH         "1" (default) to require an authenticated gh; "0" to skip
#                                (e.g. a setup run that won't open a PR until later).
#
# Resume detection: the NEWEST runs/*.dispatch whose track==TRACK_ID. Its run_id is the
# resume key; the caller then hands that RUN_ID to track-reconcile.sh.
#
# Requires: jq, git. gh only when PREFLIGHT_REQUIRE_GH=1. Keep runtime < 5s.

# Only the caller's value may override the id this run picks; a file-supplied one is an
