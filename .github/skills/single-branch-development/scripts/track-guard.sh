# track-guard.sh — PreToolUse guard for the executing-parallel-tracks skill.
#
# Makes two of the skill's gates MECHANICAL instead of prompt-trusted:
#   1. Deny-by-default file ownership (per worktree) + frozen entrypoints.
#   2. Worker push/merge lockout — workers stop at `gh pr create --draft`.
#
# Wiring: copy this file + the bundled track-hooks.json into the repo's
# .github/hooks/ directory (the JSON points VS Code / Copilot CLI / cloud agent
# at this script).
# Requires: jq. Keep runtime < 5s — hooks block the agent synchronously.
#
# Per-worktree scope (export BEFORE launching each worker):
#   TRACK_ALLOWED_PREFIXES  colon-separated path prefixes this track may edit, relative to
#                           the git WORKTREE ROOT (never to the hook's CWD), e.g.
#                           "internal/ingest:migrations/0007_:test/ingest".
#                           A path outside every worktree stays absolute, so allowing a
#                           scratch dir means listing it absolutely, e.g. "/tmp/scratch/".
#   TRACK_FROZEN_PATHS      colon-separated exact files no track may edit, e.g.
#                           "cmd/main.go:internal/app/app.go"
#   TRACK_IMMUTABLE_PREFIXES  (optional) colon-separated prefixes whose
#                           already-committed files are append-only, e.g.
#                           "migrations/:backend-go/migrations/". A NEW file under
#                           the prefix is fine; editing one with git history is denied.
#
# Always-on (no env needed): any file whose first 3 lines carry a
# "GENERATED — DO NOT EDIT" banner is denied — re-run its generator instead.
#
# Opt-in destructive-infra guard (off unless set):
#   TRACK_GUARD_DESTRUCTIVE  set to any value to also deny irreversible data/infra
#                            shell commands (DROP/TRUNCATE, unbounded DELETE, Redis
#                            FLUSHALL/FLUSHDB, NATS stream/consumer teardown,
#                            rm -rf on an absolute/home path). Tune per stack.
#
# Opt-in fast-forward push (off unless set):
#   TRACK_ALLOW_FF_PUSH      set to any value to permit a plain `git push` (e.g. a
#                            PR-rework flow updating an existing PR branch). --force,
#                            --no-verify, gh pr merge, git merge, and reset --hard
#                            stay denied, so only a fast-forward push is allowed.
#
# NOTE: Copilot/VS Code ignores hook "matchers", so under that surface this script
# fires on EVERY tool call and branches on tool_name itself. Claude Code DOES scope
# by matcher (see the .claude/settings.json wiring), but the branching stays so a
# single script serves both surfaces. Tool names / input keys differ across
# surfaces — VS Code: create_file / replace_string_in_file + run_in_terminal,
# camelCase tool_input.filePath; Claude Code: Write / Edit / MultiEdit + Bash,
# snake_case file_path / command. All are handled below.

# Bootstrap: load hook presets sitting beside this script, if present:
#   1. track-env.sh       per-worktree LOCAL overrides (gitignored, optional)
#   2. track-env.base.sh  repo-wide COMMITTED defaults (travels into every worktree)
# Local is sourced first so a worktree value wins over the repo base; every line
# uses ${VAR:-default}, so an already-exported value (e.g. an executing-parallel-
# tracks per-track override) still wins over both. No-op when a file is absent.

# Normalize a tool-supplied path to a path relative to the git worktree ROOT it
# belongs to. TRACK_ALLOWED_PREFIXES is written relative to the worktree root, so the
# comparison is only meaningful against a root-relative path — and the hook's $PWD is
# NOT a reliable stand-in for that root. Two ways it drifts, both observed in real runs:
#
#   * a sibling WORKTREE holds the isolated work while the agent (and $PWD) stay rooted
#     in the main checkout, and
#   * a plain `cd` into a subdirectory in an earlier Bash call — after which a $PWD-strip
#     yields "contracts/agent-graph.md" for a file the scope names as
#     "specs/001-x/contracts/agent-graph.md".
#
# Both end the same way: the relativized path never matches a prefix, every scoped write
# is denied (fail-closed), and the pressure is toward ungoverned terminal-heredoc writes.
# So resolve against the worktree root UNCONDITIONALLY — relative inputs included, since
# a bare "contracts/x.md" typed from a subdirectory is exactly the case that used to slip
# through. `git rev-parse --show-prefix` is git's own answer to "where am I inside this
# worktree?", which also sidesteps the string-strip mismatch when a checkout is reached
# through a symlink (/tmp on macOS) and git reports the physical path instead. create_file
# targets — and their parent dirs — may not exist yet, so resolve from the deepest
# EXISTING ancestor and re-attach the not-yet-created tail.
#
# Emits TWO lines: the discovered worktree root (may be empty) and the root-relative path.
# The root has to come back through STDOUT rather than a global, because the caller reads
# this function in a command substitution — a variable it sets dies with that subshell.
# That is why the immutable-prefix check silently fell back to `$PWD` and stopped matching
# whenever the hook's CWD was not the worktree root: exactly the sibling-worktree case the
# root-tracking was added for, so the check quietly passed everything it was meant to stop.
