# track-note.sh — SELF-REPORTED run annotations. NOT a hook, NOT mechanically observed.
#
# The meter/trace/evidence hooks only record what a PostToolUse/Subagent hook can
# actually see (tool-call count, subagent spawns, test output). Several things the model
# knows but no hook can observe are (1) which skill it is currently executing, (2) how
# many implement→review loops it has run, (3) WHERE IN THE PIPELINE the run currently
# is, (4) that the run has reached a non-success terminal state, and (5) where the
# persisted governance bundle lives. This CLI lets the skill *assert* those into the run
# record — so they are the model's own claim, not a verified fact.
#
# To keep that honest, everything written here is provenance-tagged:
#   - skills[] entries carry  self_reported:true
#   - the loop counter lives in  iterations  and a mirror  iterations_self_reported:true
#     flag is set the first time it is touched, so a reader can never mistake either
#     array/scalar for hook-observed truth.
#   - phase / status / governance_bundle each carry  self_reported:true  inside the object.
#
# WHY phase/status/governance EXIST (the compaction problem)
#   A long run gets its context compacted mid-flight. Compaction is NOT a new session, so
#   SessionStart (and therefore track-reconcile.sh) does not fire, and the model silently
#   loses: which execution core it chose, whether the RED suite is frozen, which increment
#   it was on, and the governance excerpts it must embed in every subagent brief.
#   Evidence freshness cannot recover any of that — it only says which test kinds are
#   current. These three subcommands put that position in a FILE, so a compacted (or
#   crashed) session re-anchors from durable state instead of re-reading the worktree,
#   which the skill's own resume invariant forbids.
#
# Wire it from the SKILL prompt (not track-hooks.json): call `note skill …` at the top
# of each core step, `note loop …` once per RED→GREEN→review cycle, `note phase …` at
# EVERY pipeline-step boundary (mandatory — it is the resume anchor), `note governance …`
# once the bundle is persisted, and `note status …` on any non-success terminal state.
#
# Usage (no-op unless RUN_ID is set):
#   track-note.sh skill <name> [step]        append {t, skill, step, self_reported:true} to skills[]
#   track-note.sh loop  [phase]              iterations += 1  (+ optional phase label on the mark)
#   track-note.sh phase <mode> <step>        SET phase={mode,step,t} (overwritten) + append phase_log[]
#   track-note.sh governance <file>          SET governance_bundle={path,sha,t} — the persisted bundle
#   track-note.sh status <state> [blocker] [next_step]
#                                            SET status (+ blocker/next_step). state must be one of
#                                            success | blocked | no-progress | budget-exceeded
#
# Opt-in via env:
#   RUN_ID    stable run-id for this worker  (REQUIRED — no-op when unset)
#   RUNS_DIR  where run records live (default: runs)
