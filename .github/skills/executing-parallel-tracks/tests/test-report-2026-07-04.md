## Summary

All structural, behavioural, and extreme-parallel quality-gates for the
`executing-parallel-tracks` skill were exercised across **27 test suites**
(188 assertions total). Zero skips; the ephemeral temp-git approach means every
assertion runs without needing a committed branch.

**Suites 1–17** are the documentation / contract fence: SKILL.md structural
completeness, track-manifest template fields, embedded run-record JSON schema,
ownership-overlap precheck logic, guard hook cross-worktree isolation (file
ownership + merge/push lockout), track-meter global budget ceiling, hard-stop
taxonomy, terminal state exhaustiveness, Docker isolation, run-ID 4-surface
traceability, stale-PR bounce protocol, and five extreme-parallel edge cases
(over-cap, all-blocked, global-budget mid-wave, smoke-first gate,
goal-as-contract).

**Suites 18–27** are the new *behavioral* layer added in this round: each drives
a real hook or gate script and asserts on actual allow/deny/block/output
decisions — a behavior regression now fails even if the prose is untouched. New
scripts covered: `track-guard.sh` CLI surface (`Write`/`Edit`/`MultiEdit`),
`track-evidence.sh` + `track-evidence-gate.sh` (capture fingerprint, fresh/
stale/failing/missing classification), `track-preflight.sh` (RUN-ID mint/
resume/breadcrumb/hard-fail), `track-sentinel.sh` (staged-secret and
debug-leftover scan), `track-trace.sh` (append-only activation trace),
`track-notify.sh` (fire-and-forget webhook), `track-reconcile.sh` (durable
resume report), and the new **`track-precheck.sh`** (mechanical Precheck overlap
gate, the last previously prose-only gate). An end-to-end lifecycle suite (22)
chains all five stages of a single worker run on one run-id.

---

## New Asset

### `scripts/track-precheck.sh` (parallel-only, skill-owned)

The Precheck gate's overlap check was previously documented in `SKILL.md` prose
only. This round adds a shipped script that mechanizes it the same way
`track-guard.sh` mechanizes per-worktree ownership.

**Interface:** reads a JSON array of `{id, prefixes}` (one entry per track,
`prefixes` = the same colon-separated string each worker receives as
`TRACK_ALLOWED_PREFIXES`) on stdin. Uses the identical string-prefix rule the
guard enforces, so the precheck asserts on exactly what the workers will run.

**Exit codes:**
- `0` — all pairs disjoint, fan-out may proceed.
- `2` — collision detected OR config error (empty ownership, duplicate id,
  malformed input) — fail-closed STOP.

**Output:** `{ok, tracks, collisions:[{a,b,a_prefix,b_prefix}], config_errors:[]}`.

`SKILL.md` Step 1 and References now link to it.

> invariants, and the new `track-precheck.sh` empty-array unbound variable).
