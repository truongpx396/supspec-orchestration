#!/usr/bin/env bash
# track-audit.sh — pre-completion discipline audit. Answers "did this run actually
# follow the pipeline?" from DURABLE ARTIFACTS ONLY (run record + governance bundle +
# git diff), never from the model's account of itself.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#   The hooks enforce the mechanical gates (paths, forbidden commands, counters) and the
#   evidence gate enforces freshness. Neither can see whether the run was DISCIPLINED:
#   was governance read before the first subagent, was the RED suite actually red, was
#   the reviewer a different agent than the maker, did the phases advance at all. Those
#   invariants lived only in tests/prompt-level-checklist.md — a document that has to be
#   remembered to be worth anything. This script runs the subset of that checklist which
#   is genuinely derivable, in about a second, so a "done" claim can be gated on it.
#
# THE HONESTY RULE (read before adding a check)
#   This script MUST NOT imply it verified something it cannot. Every check here is
#   derived from an artifact; everything else is printed under MANUAL as an explicit
#   "not checked here — audit by hand" list. A green audit that quietly skipped the hard
#   half is worse than no audit, because it manufactures exactly the false confidence
#   the pipeline exists to prevent. When in doubt, WARN or move it to MANUAL — never
#   invent a PASS.
#
# VERDICTS
#   FAIL — a durable artifact contradicts the pipeline contract. Exits 2 (blocks).
#   WARN — suspicious, or unverifiable on this surface. Never blocks; always printed.
#   PASS — an artifact positively confirms the check.
#   MANUAL — deliberately not mechanizable; listed so it cannot be silently forgotten.
#
# TWO MODES — deliberately split
#   CLI (default)   Always available. Run it by hand any time, and at the draft-PR
#                   boundary before `gh pr create`. Exits 2 on FAIL.
#   --hook          Stop-hook mode: OPT-IN via TRACK_AUDIT=1, honors stop_hook_active,
#                   and blocks with {decision:"block", reason} like the other Stop gates.
#   The split matters. Auditing on every Stop by default would break the bundle's
#   no-op-until-configured contract: a repo that adopts the hooks but not the governance
#   discipline would suddenly be unable to end a session. The CLI is free; the blocking
#   gate is a choice you make.
#
# Usage (no-op unless RUN_ID is set or recoverable from a breadcrumb):
#   track-audit.sh            human-readable report; exit 2 if any FAIL

#   track-audit.sh --warn-only  never exit non-zero (report, don't block)
