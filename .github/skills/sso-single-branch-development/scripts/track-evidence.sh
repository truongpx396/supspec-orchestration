# track-evidence.sh — PostToolUse: record test-command results into the run record.
#
# Makes the evidence gate tool-recorded instead of model-claimed. When a terminal
# command matches the manifest's test pattern, append { command, response } to
# runs/<RUN_ID>.json so the evidence is captured by the tool, not pasted by the model.
#
# This is the CAPTURE half of the evidence gate. The closing assertion — a fresh,
# passing entry must exist for every required pack row before done is claimed — lives
# in track-evidence-gate.sh (Stop). Capture must run on every PostToolUse so the
# record cannot be back-filled or cherry-picked at the claim moment.
#
# ACCURACY: PostToolUse exposes `tool_response` (a TEXTUAL result, possibly
# truncated) — NOT a numeric exit code. This records what the tool reported; CI
# remains the authoritative pass/fail gate.
#
# Opt-in via env (no-op unless a matcher is set):
#   RUN_ID                  stable run-id for this worker (also the record filename)
#   TRACK_TEST_CMD_PATTERN  ERE matched against the command, e.g.
#                           "go test|uv run pytest|npm (run )?test|pnpm test"
#   TRACK_EVIDENCE_KINDS    (optional) ';'-separated label:ERE pairs that both match
#                           AND tag a command with a pack kind, e.g.
#                           "go-test:go test -race;py:uv run pytest;ts:tsc --noEmit".
#                           A command matching any pair is recorded with that label
#                           so track-evidence-gate.sh can require a fresh, passing
#                           entry per kind. Patterns are repo-supplied, never baked in.
#   RUNS_DIR                where run records live (default: runs)
#
# Each entry also stores a `fingerprint` (HEAD + tracked diff + untracked content
# hashes) so the gate can tell evidence for the CURRENT tree from a stale green run
# captured edits ago.

# --- what the command RUNS, not what it merely CONTAINS -----------------------
# Patterns are matched against a sanitised copy of the command, never the raw text.
# Matching raw text lets any command that just *mentions* a test command register as
# evidence for it — and two such commands occur on essentially every run:
#
#   1. Writing the PR body. It embeds the evidence table, which quotes the very
#      commands being matched, so `cat > pr-body.md <<'EOF' … go test ./… … EOF`
#      registers as a passing `go-test`. The report ends up certifying itself.
#   2. Echoing a payload into a hook while debugging, e.g.
#      `echo '{"command":"npx tsc --noEmit"}' | bash track-evidence.sh`.
#
# Both were observed forging a full required-evidence pack on a real run. Two
# removals close them, and neither touches a command that genuinely runs a test:
#   - heredoc BODIES (the `<<EOF … EOF` payload; the command line itself is kept)
#   - quoted string LITERALS (a test command inside quotes is data being passed
#     around, not a suite being run here)
# Prefixes still work — `npx tsc --noEmit` matches a `tsc --noEmit` pattern —
# because only quoted and heredoc-borne text is dropped, not leading words.

# Text matching alone let two captures that printed `exit: 1` be graded ✅ pass.
